x Core render engine
x remove indices from vertex buffer
x extend linear algebra stuff
  x dot product and things like that
  x invert matrix
    x test matrix invert
  - rotors
x 3D unlit extension
  x Node3D transformation stuff
  x SceneTree3D
  x gltf import? Or obj?
    x loading geometry
      x test it with a mesh
    x loading materials
      x loading textures
  x proprietary mesh format
    x read/write
    x gltf to btoc
    x load btoc mesh
  x turn it into an extension
x try it with a couple of meshes [generally OK, only small meshes, no weird tfs]
  x bistro does not work because it's too big, out of memory :(
  / that castle scene is probably also too big
  x Tried some Sketchfab scenes
- Example

- optimization
  - BatchNode3D
  - sorting
    - also depth sorting probably
  - instancing?
- Multiple canvases (most importantly change `aspectRatio`)

- PBR?
  - loading PBR materials
- 2D extension
- 3D half-lambertian extension?
  - transform normals to world or view space
